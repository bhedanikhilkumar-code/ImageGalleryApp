```

### Feature Depth Matrix

| Layer | What reviewers should look for | Why it matters |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Product | Clear user problem, target audience, and workflow | Shows product thinking beyond tutorial-level code |
| Interface | Screens, pages, commands, or hardware interaction points | Demonstrates how users actually experience the project |
| Logic | Validation, state transitions, service methods, processing flow | Proves the project can handle real use cases |
| Data | Local storage, database, files, APIs, or device input/output | Explains how information moves through the system |
| Quality | Tests, linting, setup clarity, and roadmap | Makes the project easier to trust, extend, and review |

### Conceptual Data / State Model

| Entity / State | Purpose | Example fields or responsibilities |
| --- | --- | --- |
| User input | Starts the main workflow | Form values, commands, uploaded files, device readings |
| Domain model | Represents the project-specific object | Transaction, note, shipment, event, avatar, prediction, song, or task |
| Service layer | Applies rules and coordinates actions | Validation, scoring, formatting, persistence, API calls |
| Storage/output | Keeps or presents the result | Database row, local cache, generated file, chart, dashboard, or device action |
| Feedback loop | Helps improve the next interaction | Status message, analytics, error handling, recommendations, roadmap item |

### Professional Differentiators

- **Documentation-first presentation:** A reviewer can understand the project without guessing the intent.
- **Diagram-backed explanation:** Architecture and workflow diagrams make the system easier to evaluate quickly.
- **Real-world framing:** The README describes users, outcomes, and operational flow rather than only listing files.
- **Extension-ready roadmap:** Future improvements are scoped so the project can keep growing cleanly.
- **Portfolio alignment:** The project is positioned as part of a consistent, professional GitHub portfolio.

    participant D as Data/Device Layer
    U->>A: Start workflow
    A->>L: Process request
    L->>D: Save/update state
    D-->>L: State/result
    L-->>A: Return useful result
    A-->>U: Updated experience
```

## Engineering Notes

- **Separation of concerns:** UI, business logic, data/services, and platform concerns are documented as separate layers.
- **Scalability mindset:** The project structure is ready for new screens, services, tests, and deployment improvements.
- **Portfolio quality:** README content is designed to communicate value before someone even opens the code.
- **Maintainability:** Naming, setup steps, and roadmap items make future work easier to plan and review.
- **User-first framing:** Features are described by the value they provide, not just the technology used.

## Local Setup

```bash
# Open the project in Android Studio
# Sync Gradle, select an emulator/device, then run the app.

# CLI build when Gradle wrapper is available
./gradlew assembleDebug
```

## Suggested Quality Checks

Before shipping or presenting this project, run the checks that match the stack:

| Check | Purpose |

| Format/lint | Keep code style consistent and reviewer-friendly. |
| Static analysis | Catch type, syntax, and framework-level issues early. |
| Unit/widget tests | Validate important logic and user-facing workflows. |
| Manual smoke test | Confirm the main flow works from start to finish. |
| README review | Ensure documentation matches the actual repository state. |
